# Visualizing Earthquakes on a Global Scale

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize earthquake data to uncover patterns in seismic activity across the globe. Using various data visualization techniques, including geographic and temporal heatmaps, the project provides insights into earthquake frequency, magnitude, and distribution. This helps in understanding risk patterns, which is crucial for disaster preparedness and response enhancement.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which provides detailed data on earthquake occurrences worldwide. The dataset includes latitude, longitude, magnitude, depth, and time of each earthquake. The dataset can be accessed directly via the USGS API or download it from their earthquake catalog.
